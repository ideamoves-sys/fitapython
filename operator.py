#comparison operators

2 == 2 #equality check TRUE

'Hello' == 'bye' #false when cmprng text it's should be case sensetive

3 != 2 #in equality check

#chaining compariosn with logical operators

#AND OR NOT to combine the comparisons

#example
1 < 2 and 2 < 3 #chaining the operators with AND
('h' == 'h') and (2 == 2 )#true you can go with () or don't yur wish

1 == 1 or 2 == 2

not (1 == 1)

#excercise
#What Boolean will be the output of the following: a= 12 b = a-10 a > b
